Make documentation for VVVV files using special syntax within comments.

Generally the idea is to create havy comments which are hidden in all but title, then render out the full text in HTML.

So far I think going this way does save time / keep things together quite well (instead of using a seperate word processor).
But there is much more that could be done in this realm / other ways to go.
I expect perhaps to merge this into a larger project when one becomes public (as this one is a little untidy at present).
